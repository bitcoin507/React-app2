               I moved to Panama when I was twenty-eight years old. I now speak fluent Spanish.

               I am now residing in Manchester, England in the UK.
               I will most likely be spending the winter in Panama and the Summer in Manchester, 
               this way I will have two summers as in Panama what they call â€˜Summer is between November through February, even though in the Winter it is also hot, 
               it is really just the rainy season.

          <code>I actually took this course because I eventually want to learn blockchain programming. 
                I first started down the blockchain rabbit hole about six years ago, and I have been trying to learn as much as I can about the crypto space since then. 
                I have been an active HODLR, sometime trader, and avid member of various blockchain and Fintech groups. 
                I recently co-founded a company with my partners who I met while working on a Marketing campaign for Finxflo a hybrid liquidity aggregator and crypto training platform. 
                Our company is called Wolf Pack Crypto Media. We help startup blockchain projects with marketing, community development, fundraising, and more.</code>
